# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

## Font

Any nerd font should work. I use [Cascadia Mono NF](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code).

## Installation

``` bash
brew install neovim
```

Follow LazyVim's [installation guide](https://www.lazyvim.org/installation), but replace the repository url with this repository.
